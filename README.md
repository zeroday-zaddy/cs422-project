Datasets:
Cannabis Species EDA and Models Pipeline
Leafly Strains
Terpene Profiler  Example Features from terpene-profiler (Github)

Problem:
Background of the problem:
Use terpenes and other scientific features of cannabis strains to predict qualitative effects (given through a potency rating) as described by sites such as Leafly (other sites to be added) 
Description of learning problem:
Supervised learning problem.

Hypothesis:
Terpene profiles and other chemical makeup information has a direct effect on cannabinoid user consciousness during their experience.

Data to use:
Leafly Strains
Example Features from terpene-profiler (Github)

Experiment:
Use decision trees (initially)/ random forest to see if the problem is applicable to machine learning. In this stage we would predict the main qualitative Leafly effect. Then later we will use multiclass prediction with more complex model algorithms for whether the Leafly effect is there or not (multiclass). For example neural networks.

Results:
